###Caveats

Tumblr will auto-inject inline code (such as [Open Graph Protocol](http://ogp.me/), [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview) & javascript) into the final output of your page. This is out of the developers' control. Running it through a HTML Validator or Page Speed may spit out warnings & errors.
